========================================
Group Project Client: Prototype - Stable
========================================

Setup:

The setup of this should be more self explanitary, however before
you start running this program ensure that you run follow the 
server README first, and copy the NODELIST.ser, created in the Server
and paste it into this folder before you follow the next steps. 

Once the above is completed you next need to load this folder 
in you terminal/cmd and enter the following command.
Java -jar Client.jar

The Gui should load and then run continue testing from there.  


Any questions just ask me

Regards
