========================================
Group Project Server: Prototype - Stable
========================================

Setup:

The sql servers have already been setup and added to the folder already.
To run the server, enter the following command when in the terminal/cmd.
Java -jar Server.jar

This will load the initial setup of the server, a random password will be 
generated. NOTE it down, this is the only time it will be visible to you.

Once the initial setup has been completed, login to the server using the 
password generated. Once logged in successfully, the server will go 
it's update script and load all the correct sockets to accept connections. 
From here leave the terminal running, you can now run the client file.

There will be several files created in your directory, during the setup 
DO NOT ALTER ANY OF THEM, else the server will need to be completely reset.

Any questions just ask me

Regards
